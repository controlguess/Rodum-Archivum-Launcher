# Rodum-Launcher
Rodum is a fork of Archivium that was completely edited to install and run on the following operating systems:
Fedora Workstation
Nobara (very likely)
Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux (with EPEL)
Bazzite / Silverblue (with caveats)

Info about immutable distros (like Silverblue / Bazzite)
These don’t allow normal dnf install in the same way.
👉 On those, users would need:
rpm-ostree install wine
OR use a container (like Toolbox)

Your script will fail there unless adapted
